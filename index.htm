            <h1>STPEHEN BERRELLI</h1>
            <p>I am currently a student at Valencia College studying computer science. 
               I have taken introductory courses on languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, and CSS.
               I hope to learn the fundamentals of html should I need to implement them one day down the line. I believe
               that even a basic understanding of web development would be useful to any software engineer whether they
               are interested in front or back end programming.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of computer science, I am a server at a Korean BBQ restraunt near universal. I enjoy playing video games with friends and playing pick-up soccer.
               My favorite song right now is, <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273660c9c4d584420ed1eb7faa6" alt="Modern Fear">
